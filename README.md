Opening a locker is an easy job for most of us in daily life. However, it turns out to be a
difficult task for people with physical impairment. The goal of this project is to help students
with impairment that may not able to open their lockers on their own in Depew High School.
One of the ways is to design an automated locker that can automatically open the lockers for
them. We came up with the solution by using RFID to assist them with these problems.
